## Hi there, I'm Fatima ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building the foundation for my journey as a front-end developer.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small projects to sharpen my skills and gain real-world experience.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m excited to connect with other self-taught developers, especially those who understand the challenges of learning independently.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about staying organized as a self-taught learner, overcoming obstacles, and finding motivation throughout a long journey.
